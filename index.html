        Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy.
        Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who
        possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability (i.e., endurance or
        strength). A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all
        aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only
        cardio/respiratory or only weight training. Developing research has
        demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through
        the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting
        muscles release multiple substances known as myokines, which promote the
        growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory
        functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various
        inflammatory diseases.
